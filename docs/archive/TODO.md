1. SEMV_HOME is rendundant, .semv.rc shuuld be stored in the fx/semv/etc directory (SEMV_ETC); fix this then remove SEMV_HOME; 

2. Too much code redundancy, helper functions are not implemented correctly for repeat code, we need to identify 
the repeated code and determine additional helper functions and reduce the amount of repeated code.

3. This script is not following the Lazy variables pattern, example dispatcher using `func_name` instead of a shorter name like "func"

4. flag semantics, the comments and code have the wrong paradigm and misunderstand a BashFX nuance, 0 means true, 1 is false, in all bash/cli scripts per the shell paradigm. What was provided in Bashfx was that if you are using stderr printers that rely on opt_debug to be enabled in order to print, then you should set `DEBUG_MODE=0` as a default in your code to ensure that any QUITE(1) printers display properly by default so the user doesnt experience messages not displaying.  somehow theyve confused this to think that 0 means disabled, it does not.

5. we dont need TERM guards, we assume color for these user scripts by default.

6. do not change my parameter expansion in my printer patterns. this is a standard pattern and changing this will break paradigm where this is widely used. (prefix)
