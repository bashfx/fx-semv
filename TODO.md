Opportunities.


1. __confirm. as long as your change is an improvement and not a regression this is fine. Be sure to test it, if you can use a fake tty call to automate the confirm interactive testing. Confer with me if this is not possible, however my understanding is that the `script` command and others can achieve this fake tty for automation.

2. options semantics. if comments and documentation are wrong they can be changed. To clarify, if the script is relying heavily on QUITE(1) printers, then these are disabled by default per BashFX QUIET specification. To overcome this, is to make them locally enabled by default via DEBUG_MODE=0, and TRACE_MODE=0 if QUIET(2) printers are used for expressing user messages. We do not follow standard log-level paradigm rather this is the terminal UX paradigm enabled by BashFX. Any comment or document that incorrectly goes against these notions should be correctd.

3. SEMV_ETC. yes these XDG+ paths should be consistently named, esepcially if theyre the namespaced paths on top of XDG+. SEMV_CONFIG as an XDG+ path is semnatically incorrect, and should be SEMV_ETC_HOME instead. To clarify SEMV_ETC is also insufficient the correct pattern is {NAMESPACE}_{XDG_PATH}_HOME for all FX-related projects. These are key as they respect the rewindable installation architecture and the names are predictible and consistent. This means any other Namespaced XDG+ path that isnt using the _HOME suffix for top level directories like `lib,etc,data` are incorrect and should be updated wherever they occur in the code.

4. tag helper dedup. yes please consolidate

5. the build.sh -r pattern is for manual automation, it may be risky but consider this is a versioned codebase, so we always have a history if this cleanup becomes a problem. build.sh is made like this on purpose, because if a dev manually ads a numbered file that doesnt match with the map, the implied intention is to replace the old version number file with the new differntly named one.

6. your test callouts are in line with FX3 test cermemony requirements.

7. strip ansi, at your discretion here. I Just want tests that work, and tests with proper visual ceremonies when I need to run it manually.

8. comments on semv_home migration. any lingering comments may just be stale data that needs to be removed or corrected. if comments like this are out of date, consider cleaning them up

9. README update is preferred of course.

10. confirm is designed to be a single character - instant action -- so a mistype is considered a NO if yes (y) is not explicit. Confirm is not meant to be a secure safe guard, rather a bumper. Other higher tier measures are employed when deeper security and safety are necessary. Confirm works like this every where, but if your suggesting an explicit keystroke be required in all cases (even no) then that is fine to, but it fundmentally alters confirm, you may rename to something like _safe_confirm, if you do employ that. because that particular confirm function is used widely in our script library, so change the name as well if you do update it.

11. the shift guarding, and shellcheck clean up is desired, as long as it doesnt break anything. The challenge with these type of refactors is unintended consequences downstream, and these types of changes require additional testing to prove no regressions. If that effort is worth the trade off of the increased safety then we can consider it.

12. I dont know that we need any DEFAULT_* variables at all, just use the standard ones and let the options command massage them as necessary, cascading the priority into the final values.
