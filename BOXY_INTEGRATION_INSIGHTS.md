# Boxy Integration Insights

## Quick Overview: Why Boxy?

Boxy provides a structured orchestration layer that transforms complex workflows into manageable, testable units. Its value comes from:
- **Separation of concerns** - Business logic vs implementation details
- **Predictable state management** - Know what's happening when
- **Testable workflows** - Mock at the orchestrator level, not implementation
- **Reusable patterns** - Consistent approach across different features

## Integration Patterns

### Orchestrator Pattern (Preferred)
```bash
# Create focused orchestrators for specific workflows
boxy_semv_orchestrator() {
    local action=$1
    case "$action" in
        validate) _orchestrate_validation "$@" ;;
        update)   _orchestrate_update "$@" ;;
        sync)     _orchestrate_sync "$@" ;;
    esac
}

# Keep orchestrators thin - delegate to implementations
_orchestrate_validation() {
    boxy task start "validation"
    local result=$(implementation_validate "$@")
    boxy task complete "validation" "$result"
}
```

### Direct Integration (Avoid)
```bash
# DON'T: Mix boxy calls throughout implementation
bad_function() {
    boxy task start "process"  # Scattered boxy calls
    do_work
    boxy update "halfway"      # State pollution
    more_work
    boxy task end "process"    # Hard to test
}
```

## View System Coordination

### Three-Tier View Pattern
```bash
# 1. Data View - Raw state, no formatting
boxy_view_data() {
    echo "version:$current_version"
    echo "state:$current_state"
}

# 2. Simple View - Basic formatting for scripts
boxy_view_simple() {
    local data=$(boxy_view_data)
    format_for_consumption "$data"
}

# 3. Full View - Rich UI for humans
boxy_view_full() {
    local data=$(boxy_view_data)
    render_with_colors_and_layout "$data"
}
```

### View Selection Strategy
- **Default to simple** for most integrations
- **Use data** when piping to other tools
- **Reserve full** for interactive terminals only
- **Never mix** view logic with business logic

## Critical Do's and Don'ts

### DO:
- **Create task-specific orchestrators** - One orchestrator per workflow type
- **Keep orchestration thin** - Orchestrators coordinate, implementations work
- **Use consistent naming** - `boxy_<feature>_orchestrator` pattern
- **Test at boundaries** - Mock orchestrator calls, not internals
- **Fail fast** - Validate early in orchestrator before delegation

### DON'T:
- **Scatter boxy calls** - Centralize in orchestrators only
- **Create god orchestrators** - Split complex workflows
- **Mix concerns** - Views display, orchestrators flow, implementations work
- **Ignore error states** - Every task needs error handling
- **Assume synchronous** - Design for async possibilities

## Testing Approaches

### Unit Testing Pattern
```bash
test_orchestrator_isolation() {
    # Mock the implementation
    implementation_validate() { echo "mocked_valid"; }
    
    # Test orchestrator logic only
    result=$(boxy_orchestrator validate "input")
    assert_equals "expected" "$result"
}
```

### Integration Testing Pattern
```bash
test_workflow_integration() {
    # Setup test environment
    export BOXY_TEST_MODE=1
    
    # Run full workflow
    boxy_orchestrator process "test_data"
    
    # Verify state transitions
    assert_task_completed "validation"
    assert_task_completed "processing"
}
```

### State Verification
```bash
# Always verify state transitions, not just outcomes
verify_boxy_state() {
    local expected_sequence=("init" "validating" "processing" "complete")
    local actual=$(boxy task history | cut -d: -f2)
    assert_sequence_matches "$expected" "$actual"
}
```

## Common Integration Mistakes

1. **Over-orchestration** - Not everything needs boxy
   - Simple functions don't need orchestration
   - Use for workflows with multiple steps/states

2. **Under-abstraction** - Mixing levels
   - Keep implementation details out of orchestrators
   - Don't leak boxy concepts into business logic

3. **State pollution** - Too many state updates
   - Update state at logical boundaries only
   - Avoid progress percentages unless critical

4. **View coupling** - Business logic in views
   - Views should only format existing data
   - Never compute or fetch in view functions

## When to Use Boxy

### Good Fit:
- Multi-step workflows (validation → processing → output)
- Long-running operations needing status updates
- Complex state machines with clear transitions
- Features requiring detailed audit trails
- Parallel or async task coordination

### Poor Fit:
- Simple input/output functions
- Pure calculations or transformations
- Utility functions without state
- Performance-critical hot paths
- Single-responsibility micro-functions

## Practical Integration Checklist

- [ ] Identified clear workflow boundaries
- [ ] Created focused orchestrator(s)
- [ ] Separated view logic from business logic
- [ ] Implemented error handling at each step
- [ ] Added appropriate test coverage
- [ ] Documented state transitions
- [ ] Verified no boxy calls in implementation
- [ ] Tested view outputs independently
- [ ] Validated error recovery paths
- [ ] Reviewed for over-engineering

## Key Takeaway

Boxy shines when you have complex workflows that benefit from clear state management and observation. Use it to orchestrate, not to implement. Keep orchestrators thin, views pure, and implementations boxy-agnostic. This separation ensures testable, maintainable, and evolvable systems.
